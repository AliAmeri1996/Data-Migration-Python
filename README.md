This Python program automates the process of fetching artwork data from the Metropolitan Museum of Artâ€™s public API, transforming that data, and uploading it to another platform,  using their API. The program retrieves a list of painting IDs from the Met Museum, processes each painting by fetching its details and image, and then concurrently uploads the transformed data and image to a designated API. The program leverages the requests library for API communication, concurrent.futures for handling multiple tasks concurrently, and io.BytesIO for managing image data in memory.
